Once upon a time there was a planet called Cnep. People of Cnep were living in peace and serenity. Suddenly the spacecraft of darkness casted its shadow over the planet.
Iron men from the spacecraft landed on the planet and raided the people who were hiding in bunkers.
At the same time, the commanders from all over the planet gathered together and formed a resistance movement. They had to resist the onslaught of aliens by tower defenses which were made by engineers.
Eventually the aliens head’s spacecraft was destroyed during a hard battle. 
Finally the fellowship of resistance returned to their planet with honor and glory, after defending against invaders and liberating the captives who were captured by aliens.

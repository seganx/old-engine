	Desc:		This file contain a base gesture recognizer for Unity Engine
    
    Concept:    Any gesture recognizer should be extended from this class. 
                The base class will attaches itself to the Gesture Manager 
                on Awake function. 
                So the gesture will be available on manager and a reference 
                to the manager would be exist in gesture automatically.

                The Type parameter will be used as priority. So each gestures
                with higher priority has more chance to recognize the gesture
                first and became as selected one.
                
                There is two important functions which must be overridden. one 
                for process and recognize the gesture and the other function 
                for update the data on the manager.

                for more information just scroll your eyes down.
